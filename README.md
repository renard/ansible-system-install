# System install

This Ansible role installs a Linux system on a remote host. It can
install [Debian](https://debian.org), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/),
[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/),
[OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/),
[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/), and
[Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) distributions.

## Warning - Danger zone

Using this role is dangerous. It destroy any existing data from all
drives found on the remote system without any confirmation. Do not use
if you have any data on the remote machine. There is absolutely no way
to recover deleted data. This role has no brain, use your own.

## Prerequisite

You will need to boot your server using a live CD or use a PXE boot
that let your hard drive unused. This role has been designed to
against run against a recent Debian (Buster) system (understand a
machine booted with a Debian live CD). It may also work from older
Debian live CD or with Ubuntu live CD.

You can find live images on following sites:

- https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
- http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

With Debian live images *ssh* is not installed by default. You have to log
in and run following commands:

```shell
sudo -s
apt-get update
apt-get install openssh-server
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

If you are using VirtualBox you can run a script like:

```shell
VBoxManage controlvm TARGET_VM keyboardputstring \
	   "sudo bash -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server; /etc/init.d/ssh restart;ip a l'"
VBoxManage controlvm TARGET_VM keyboardputscancode 1c 9c
```


If you are using Private Server hosting you should reboot the server in
rescue mode. This might also work with some Virtual Private Server
provider. Please check your provider support.


## Role Description

The install process runs in several parts:

- Remove all partitions and create a new partition scheme (see
  `system_install_partitions` variable).
- Install deployment tools (such as *debootstrap*, *yum*, *apk*...)
  depending on the target system.
- Bootstrap the system and install additional packages (see
  `system_install_additional_packages`).
- Fix *ssh* configuration to allow **root** login (`PermitRootLogin` is set
  to `yes`).
- Update *grub* configuration to be more verbose and install it on the hard
  drive.

See [tasks/README.md]() for further details on how system install works.


### Security warning

Setting up a root password and allowing *ssh* access using this method is
not secure. Please consider using ssh keys and do not forget to secure the
system after the reboot from hard drive.

## Configuration

Link [roles/playbook-system-install.yml]() to your Ansible playbooks
directory.

See specific documentation in defaults files in [defaults/main]().

## Invocation

Run:

```
./playbook-system-install.yml [ -u user ] -l hostname [ -e VAR="value" ]
```

All variables from the [defaults/main]() files can be set on the
command line as well. For convenience some other variables can be set
from the command line using the `-e` option (can be specified multiple
times):

* `password`: SSH password on remote live system (not on the chrooted
  environment). Use this if you cannot use a ssh key. Unset by default.
* `host_key_checking`: Set to *true* if ssh host key should be
  verified. Default value is *false*.
* `system_install_base`: URL to download a base system archive. If set
  OS bootstraping is disabled. Default is unset.
* `ssh_port`: SSH port within the chroot. Default is 2222.
* `chroot_python_interpreter`: python interpreter within the
  chroot. By default this value is auto-computed for each vendor and
  version however it can be overridden from the command line.


## Extra

If you want to create an image of you newly installed system for
future usage, you can run `/usr/local/bin/generate-base-image` as
root. The archive is not minimalistic but is a good start.

## Todo / roadmap

In no specific priority:

* Detect mdadm / lvm2 / cryptsetup module requirements.
* Allow to configure static IP address.
* Add more vendors (stay focus on server oriented distros).
