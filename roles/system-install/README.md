# System install

This Ansible role installs a Linux system on a remote host. It can
install [Debian](https://debian.org), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/),
[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/),
[OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/),
[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/), and
[Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) distributions.

## Prerequisite

You will need to boot your server using a live CD or use a PXE boot
that let your hard drive unused. This role has been designed to
against run against a recent Debian (Buster) system (understand a
machine booted with a Debian live CD). It may also work from older
Debian live CD or with Ubuntu live CD.

You can find live images on following sites:

- https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
- http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

With Debian live images *ssh* is not installed by default. You have to log
in and run following commands:

```shell
sudo -s
apt-get update
apt-get install openssh-server
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
```

If you are using VirtualBox you can run a script like:

```shell
VBoxManage controlvm TARGET_VM keyboardputstring \
	   "sudo bash -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server; /etc/init.d/ssh restart;ip a l'"
VBoxManage controlvm TARGET_VM keyboardputscancode 1c 9c
```


If you are using Private Server hosting you should reboot the server in
rescue mode. This might also work with some Virtual Private Server
provider. Please check your provider support.


## Role Description

The install process runs in several parts:

- Remove all partitions and create a new partition scheme (see
  `system_install_partitions` variable).
- Install deployment tools (such as *debootstrap*, *yum*, *apk*...)
  depending on the target system.
- Bootstrap the system and install additional packages (see
  `system_install_additional_packages`).
- Fix *ssh* configuration to allow **root** login (`PermitRootLogin` is set
  to `yes`).
- Update *grub* configuration to be more verbose and install it on the hard
  drive.


### Security warning

Setting up a root password and allowing *ssh* access using this method is
not secure. Please consider using ssh keys and do not forget to secure the
system after the reboot from hard drive.

## Configuration

See specific documentation in defaults files in [defaults/main]().

## Extra

If you want to create an image of you newly installed system for
future usage, you can run `/usr/local/bin/generate-base-image` as
root. The archive is not minimalistic but is a good start.
